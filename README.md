# BlankDAO (Draft 2.0)

BlankDAO is a social organization with an aim to break blockchain barriers on the road to decentralization by relying on real people instead of miners or stakeholders.

After a decade since decentralization was initiated with Bitcoin we have come up with a solution that allows us to get rid of limitations of proof of work and stake which were mere vessels to prevent sybil attacks. The birth of [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) makes it possible to define DApps that can be sybil attack free without relying on POW or POS.

## Goal

The goal in BlankDAO is to decentralize everything. It supports development for DApps that are fully open-source and require zero-fee. 

## Constitution

1. There are 21 million tokens in total that are created gradually and periodically according to a predefined function of time.

2. All of the decisions in the DAO are done based on one person one vote.

## Tokens

The tokens in the organization are limited to 21 million, issued periodically similar to Bitcoin, and distributed among the following groups who contribute to the advancement of DApps:

* Hosting providers
* Open source developers
* End users

## Governance

Governance in BlankDAO determines the details of supported DApps and distribution of incentives among them. This process is done based on one vote per person which is only possible with [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/).

# **New Possibilities**

## First Decentralized Ledger Based On Proof Of Uniqueness

### High Security

Decentralized ledgers like blockchain are vulnerable to double-spending attacks from owners of strong processing power or large numbers of stakes.

BlankDAO, for the first time, can have a decentralized ledger that is immune to double spend attacks by giving every individual a single vote regardless of their processing power or number of stakes.

### Zero Fees

BlankDAO prevents sybil attacks by relying on proof of uniqueness (not POW or POS) and because the costs of decentralized hosting are paid by the DAO as a part of the periodic distribution of generated tokens, DApps can require zero fees from end users for reasonable amounts of usage.

### Decentralized Scalability

In previous approaches, there was a see-saw relationship between decentralization and scalability. In other words, higher decentralization reduces scalability and vice versa. 

In BlankDAO however, proof of uniqueness results in high scalability by maintaining governance of all users while hosting the ledger on a reasonable number of hosts.

Simply put, blockchain DApps are hosted by all but governed by some. In contrast, BlankDApps are actually hosted by some but governed by all.

## Brand New Distribution Of Tokens

### Unchained Value

BlankDAO’s distribution of tokens results in faster advancement of the ecosystem.

In blockchain, newly generated tokens are distributed among miners to provide security. A process that ends in low scalability for developers and high costs for end users as well.

BlankDAO ensures security with minimum costs by using POU to prevent sybil attacks. Therefore, for the first time, the created value can be used for creating added value.

### Incentivized Open Source Development

In BlankDAO a part of newly generated tokens is distributed among developers to encourage innovations and advancements.

### Incentivized MarketPlace

A part of generated tokens in BlankDAO is used as incentive for Providers of goods and services like supermarkets and taxi-drivers to support and accept native tokens in exchange for goods and services they offer. This approach expands the utility of tokens beyond digital services.

### Incentivized End Users

Blockchain DApps tend to suffer from low adoption because most users are still more interested in their centralized counterparts. Network effect also prevents their high adoption in early stages. 

Accordingly, in BlankDAO, early users are incentivized by a part of newly generated tokens not just because of accepting early adoption difficulties but also for putting out their social capital to attract larger adoption.

## New Financial Possibilities

### Decentralized Exchange

Current decentralized exchanges not only suffer from  low scalability but, more importantly, they can only support tokens that are native to one blockchain. DEX on Ethereum for instance can only support ETH and ERC-20 tokens. There is no way for them to support Bitcoin, ZCash, etc. without relying on a third party.

This is the first time we can implement a decentralized exchange based on 1 vote per person. An exchange that is as scalable as their central counterparts. They are fully open source. People funds are saved in multi-signature cold wallets, keys of which are in control of a reasonable number of delegates selected by people.

### Reserve Banking

In current monetary systems, reserve banks issue money and back it by their gold reserves.

Similarly, BlankDAO issues stablecoins and back them by its native tokens. The stablecoins are neither backed by nor pegged to fiat money.

This is the very first time that a new generation of stable money is issued that unlike government issued money, has zero inflation forever and is pegged to a CPI defined by people and not local governments.

### Decentralized Credit Network

Credit assessment and credit card issuance in so far has always exclusively been done by centralized organizations.

Blockchain could never solve this problem since it lacked a decentralized ID system in which users can not escape their past behavior and negative reputation. 

[BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/), for the first time, enables BlankDAO to have credit assessment DApps that rely on end users’ social credit to provide end users with loans accordingly. 

# **Genesis**

## DAO

At genesis point the DAO will be built on Aragon because it has provided the most reliable technical infrastructure for decentralized governance. That initially makes BlankDAO an Aragon DAO that is hosted on Ethereum.

As soon as the voting DApp for BlankDAO are launched, it will use its own voting DApp as its technical infrastructure.

## Governance

Due to the high risk and inefficiency of decentralizing a non-existing system, Initial members of the DAO will be those who contribute to development of the ecosystem. People will replace developers by their delegates as soon as the system reaches a minimum maturity.

Minimum maturity is achieved when the system has 100K users holding minimum $100 worth of DAO tokens each.

## Tokens

The tokens will be created, hosted and transferred on Ethereum until the ledger DApp is launched.

Until the ledger DApp is launched, the tokens will be created by a crowdsale smart contract and hosted on Ethereum.

Upon the launch of ledger DApp, previously created tokens hosted on Ethereum, will be exchanged 1/1 by the ledger native tokens. 

Newly created tokens won’t be sold in crowdsale on Ethereum anymore. They will rather be distributed among developers, hosting providers, and DApp users. The details of token distribution will be determined by the DAO. 

## Revenues

At genesis point, DAO tokens will be sold to investors by a crowdsale smart contract on Ethereum. The capital gained from the crowdsale will be transferred to a DAO as its revenue. 

The crowdsale smart contract generates 50 new tokens every 10 minutes. The price is set in advance for the first stack and will go higher by 1% for each of the further stacks unless they are not sold. If the stacks are not fully sold, newly generated tokens will be saved in the smart contract and are put into crowdsale at their original price. Once the generated and saved stacks of tokens in the smart contract are sold, the 1% price rise continues.

This approach of price setting in the crowdsale results into creation of secondary markets in exchanges in which the tokens might have a lower price. Investors buy tokens directly from the smart contract only if they cannot find a better deal in extra exchanges. 

## Expenditures

At genesis point, the DAO is formed of three sectors. The revenues will be transferred to the DAO and distributed among the sectors according to DAO’s governance.

### Development

Development expenditures address core DApp development costs which are prioritized according to the road map of the project. The DAO will try to keep the open source development of the core DApps decentralized and utilize as many developers as possible so long as it does not stop the DAO from reaching its road map milestones. 

### Public relations

Public relations include content creation for different media, website management, and activities in various social networks like Reddit, Twitter, etc. 

DAO will assign a part of its revenues to crowdsource tasks of public relations and use the potential capacities and skills of all its members. 

### Expansion

A rewarding system is defined in the DAO that incentivizes certain tasks e.g. joining the ID network, referring others to the system, etc. Those who perform these task receive points accordingly and enjoy the rewards as defined in the DAO.

### Market Making

Upon the genesis point, half of the funds that are received by BlankDAO through the crowdsale will be used to prevent possible price falls to some extent. 
By using that part of the funds, buy orders will be placed in the exchange to make it possible for investors to easily sell their tokens at a suitable price. Towards the end of the genesis period, the amount of saved funds that are used for buy orders will decrease gradually.

# **FAQ**

### DApps have zero fees, so what’s the utility of tokens in BlankDAO?

Many zero fee DApps in BlankDAO - like decentralized Uber, Amazon, Airbnb etc. - are commercial and require financial transactions between end users, and they need to use native tokens in their payments.
